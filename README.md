# DosSonosDeviceAutomatically
Dos a Sonos device on local network automatically.

Clone and start.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CollinEdward/DosSonosDeviceAutomatically.git
cd DosSonosDeviceAutomatically
python3 DosSonosDevice.py
```

This script automatically detects if any sonos device is on the network, and then asks if you want to dos it.
This scirpt is made solely for testing and educational puposes.

I might also make a GUI version of this.
